# STGNN for Large Red Chili Pepper Availability Prediction
## üå∂ Predicting the availability of large red chili peppers in Banyuwangi Regency.

This project applies Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) to model and predict the availability of agricultural commodities based on spatial and temporal data. Built using PyTorch and torch-geometric, it integrates advanced graph-based machine learning techniques for accurate predictions.

### üîç Key Features: 
- **Data Normalization:** <br /> 
Preprocessing multi-dimensional features like temperature, wind speed, and humidity for model training. <br /> 
- **Graph Construction:** <br /> 
Representing spatial relationships as graphs, visualized using NetworkX. <br /> 
- **Spatio-Temporal Modeling:** large red
Utilizing STGNN to combine spatial and temporal insights for predictive analysis. <br /> 
- **Visualization:** large red
Adjacency matrix heatmaps and graph representations for better interpretability of spatial relationships. <br /> 

### ‚ú® Highlights:
This project aims to support agricultural decision-making in Banyuwangi Regency by providing data-driven insights into large red chili pepper availability, enabling better supply chain planning and resilience to seasonal variability.
